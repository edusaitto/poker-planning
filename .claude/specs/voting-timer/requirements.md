# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The voting timer feature adds time-boxing capabilities to planning poker sessions, allowing Scrum Masters and facilitators to set time limits for discussions. This feature enhances meeting efficiency by keeping estimation discussions focused and preventing extended debates, while maintaining the simplicity that makes PokerPlanning.org accessible to all teams.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product vision by:
- **Feature-Rich but Simple**: Adds powerful time management without complexity
- **Advanced Voting Analysis**: Timer data can be incorporated into session analytics
- **Extreme Simplicity**: One-click timer controls that anyone can use
- **Visual and Interactive**: Modern timer display integrated into the canvas interface

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Timer Display and Controls

**User Story:** As a facilitator, I want to see and control a discussion timer on the canvas, so that I can keep estimation discussions time-boxed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the room canvas THEN the timer node SHALL be visible with a clear time display showing minutes:seconds format
2. WHEN the timer is not running THEN it SHALL display "0:00" and show a play button
3. WHEN a user clicks the play button THEN the timer SHALL start counting up from the current time
4. WHEN the timer is running THEN it SHALL show a pause button instead of play button
5. WHEN a user clicks the pause button THEN the timer SHALL stop counting but retain the current time
6. WHEN a user clicks the reset button THEN the timer SHALL return to "0:00" and stop if running
7. IF the timer is at "0:00" AND not running THEN the reset button SHALL be visually disabled

### Requirement 2: Real-time Synchronization

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see the same timer state as everyone else in the room, so that we all know how much time remains for discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user starts the timer THEN all users in the room SHALL see the timer start within 500ms
2. WHEN any user pauses the timer THEN all users SHALL see the timer pause at the same time value
3. WHEN any user resets the timer THEN all users SHALL see the timer reset to "0:00"
4. IF a new user joins the room while timer is running THEN they SHALL see the current timer state immediately
5. WHEN the timer is running THEN all users SHALL see synchronized time updates every second

### Requirement 3: Timer Permissions

**User Story:** As a room participant, I want appropriate control over the timer based on my role, so that the session remains organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any participant is in the room THEN they SHALL be able to view the timer state
2. WHEN any participant clicks timer controls THEN the action SHALL be executed (collaborative control)
3. IF multiple users click controls simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle actions in order received
4. WHEN a timer action occurs THEN the user who performed it SHALL be tracked for potential future features

### Requirement 4: Timer Integration with Voting Flow

**User Story:** As a facilitator, I want the timer to work seamlessly with the voting process, so that I can manage both timing and voting efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cards are revealed THEN the timer SHALL continue running if it was already running
2. WHEN the game is reset THEN the timer SHALL also reset to "0:00" automatically
3. WHEN the timer is running THEN voting actions SHALL remain fully functional
4. IF the room becomes inactive THEN the timer state SHALL be preserved with the room

### Requirement 5: Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indicators of timer state, so that I can quickly understand if time is running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running THEN a pulsing indicator SHALL be visible next to the time
2. WHEN the timer is paused THEN the indicator SHALL be static
3. WHEN hovering over timer controls THEN appropriate hover states SHALL be shown
4. IF the timer reaches specific milestones (5min, 10min, etc.) THEN subtle visual feedback MAY be provided

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Timer updates must be smooth without causing canvas lag
- Synchronization delay must not exceed 500ms between clients
- Timer state changes must be debounced to prevent excessive server calls

### Security
- Timer state must be validated server-side to prevent manipulation
- No sensitive timing data should be exposed in the client

### Reliability
- Timer must continue accurately even if user's connection briefly drops
- Timer state must persist with room data for the 5-day retention period
- Clock drift between clients must be handled gracefully

### Usability
- Timer must be immediately understandable without instructions
- Controls must be large enough for mobile touch targets
- Timer must remain visible but not obstruct other canvas elements
- Time display must be readable at various zoom levels
