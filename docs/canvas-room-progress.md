   - Not connected to room state
   - No integration with CanvasNavigation

3. **Layout Issues**
   - Fixed circular layout doesn't utilize canvas space

## Current Development Focus

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1)
Working on fixing existing components before adding new features:

1. **Fix StoryNode Component**
   - Connect to room subscription data
   - Display actual story title and description
   - Show correct estimation status

2. **Implement Timer Functionality**
   - Add timer controls to CanvasNavigation
   - Connect TimerNode to room state
   - Implement start/stop/reset logic

3. **Clean Up Components**
   - Remove deprecated ControlsNode
   - Fix voting card positioning
   - Improve initial layout

## Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] All components use React.memo() for performance
- [ ] Event handlers use useCallback()
- [ ] Complex calculations use useMemo()
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types for all props
- [ ] ARIA labels for accessibility
- [ ] Error boundaries implemented
- [ ] Loading states for async operations
- [ ] Responsive design considerations

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests for node components
- [ ] Integration tests for voting flow
- [ ] E2E tests for Canvas Room
- [ ] Performance testing with many nodes
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Mobile/tablet testing
