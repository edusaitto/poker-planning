## Test Suites Breakdown

### 1. Room Creation Suite (`room-creation.spec.ts`)

Tests for creating and accessing poker planning rooms.

**Scenarios:**
- Create room from home page
- Create room with custom name
- Direct navigation to room URL
- Handle invalid room IDs
- Room persistence after creation

**Key Assertions:**
- Room URL is generated correctly
- Room is accessible via direct link
- Room data persists in database
- Navigation works as expected

### 2. Room Joining Suite (`room-joining.spec.ts`)

Tests for different ways users can join rooms.

**Scenarios:**
- Join as participant with valid name
- Join as spectator
- Name validation (empty, too long, special chars)
- Handle duplicate names
- Toggle between participant/spectator
- Rejoin after page refresh
- Join when room is at capacity

**Key Assertions:**
- Join dialog appears for non-members
- User preferences are saved
- Correct role is assigned
- Canvas loads after joining

### 3. Voting Flow Suite (`voting-flow.spec.ts`)

Core planning poker functionality tests.

**Scenarios:**
- Select voting card
- Change vote before reveal
- Reveal with all votes
- Reveal with partial votes
- Reset for new round
- Spectators cannot vote
- Vote persistence on refresh
- Timer integration

**Key Assertions:**
- Card selection visual feedback
- Vote count updates in real-time
- Results display correctly
- Game state resets properly

### 4. Canvas Interaction Suite (`canvas-interaction.spec.ts`)

Tests for the interactive canvas features.

**Scenarios:**
- Pan canvas by dragging
- Zoom controls (in/out/fit)
- Drag and position nodes
- Copy room URL functionality
- Fullscreen mode toggle
- Node connections display
- Canvas boundaries

**Key Assertions:**
- Smooth canvas navigation
- Node positions persist
- Controls respond correctly
- Visual feedback for interactions

### 5. Multi-User Suite (`multi-user.spec.ts`)

Real-time collaboration testing with multiple users.

**Scenarios:**
- Simultaneous user joins
- Vote synchronization
- Real-time vote count updates
- Card reveal synchronization
- User disconnect handling
- Canvas position sync
- Performance with many users

**Key Assertions:**
- Updates propagate < 1 second
- No race conditions
- Consistent state across users
- Graceful disconnection handling

### 6. Error Handling Suite (`error-handling.spec.ts`)

Tests for error scenarios and recovery.

**Scenarios:**
- Network disconnection
- API failures
- Invalid operations
- Session timeouts
- Concurrent modifications
- Browser compatibility issues

**Key Assertions:**
- Appropriate error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Recovery mechanisms work
- No data loss

## Implementation Guidelines

### Page Object Pattern

Each page object should encapsulate:
- Element selectors using data-testid
- Common actions (click, type, drag)
- Assertions specific to that page
- Wait conditions for async operations

Example structure:
```typescript
export class RoomPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}
  
  // Selectors
  get votingCards() { return this.page.getByTestId('voting-card'); }
  get revealButton() { return this.page.getByTestId('reveal-button'); }
  
  // Actions
  async selectCard(value: string) { ... }
  async revealCards() { ... }
  
  // Assertions
  async expectVoteCount(count: number) { ... }
}
```

### Multi-User Testing Pattern

For testing real-time features:
```typescript
const multiUser = new MultiUserSession();
const [userA, userB] = await multiUser.createUsers(browser, 2);

await userA.selectCard('5');
await userB.expectVoteIndicator(userA.name);
```

### Test Data Management

Centralize test data:
- User personas (names, roles)
- Card values
- Room configurations
- Error messages
- Timeouts and delays

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Deterministic**: Avoid random data where possible
3. **Descriptive**: Clear test names and assertions
4. **Fast**: Minimize waits, use test IDs
5. **Maintainable**: Reuse page objects and helpers

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1)
- Room creation tests
- Basic joining flow
- Simple voting scenarios

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2)
- Canvas interactions
- Complete voting workflows
- Timer functionality

### Phase 3: Collaboration (Week 3)
- Multi-user scenarios
- Real-time synchronization
- Performance testing

### Phase 4: Edge Cases (Week 4)
- Error handling
- Recovery mechanisms
- Browser compatibility

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: 90%+ of user flows tested
- **Reliability**: < 1% flaky tests
- **Performance**: All tests complete in < 5 minutes
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure and documentation

## Testing Checklist

Before marking a feature as tested:
- [ ] Happy path covered
- [ ] Error cases handled
- [ ] Multi-user scenarios work
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Accessibility verified
- [ ] Mobile viewport tested

## Future Enhancements

- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility automation
- Load testing for scaling
- Cross-browser matrix testing
